abstract = "The last decade witnessed an enormous growth in popularity of several social media platforms. Although these platforms are generally meant to share information and opinions, their ubiquity is being increasingly exploited for spreading news and events in real time. Hence these platforms have become a natural choice for news agencies for getting updates, comments and expertsâ€™ opinion of ongoing events which is crucial to understand the societal impact and for writing reports/editorial. However, with the plethora of these platforms available, each having its own uniqueness in content presentation, spreading patterns and also in the user interests, a comparative study of the efficacy of these platforms for different journalistic purposes would be useful. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of two leading social media platforms Reddit and Twitter. We have analyzed Reddit comments and Twitter feeds of six news categories to establish the efficacy of these platforms in terms of different journalistic requirements. Observations reveal that there exist significant differences across these platforms that can be suitably exploited depending upon the scope of the requirements; for example, while Twitter is a better choice for the evolutionary study of events, Reddit is the more natural choice for exploration during the initial phase of any event. While the availability and spread of updated information on Twitter can be key in emergency and disaster situations, critical analysis of posts in Reddit can be important for editorials."
