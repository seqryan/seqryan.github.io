I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Patna in 2018. Currently on a sabbatical and interested in pursuing research in the areas of Network Science with a focus on social-media and Deep Learning applications in interdesciplinary domains. 


Before Pursuing masters, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Persistent Systems](https://www.persistent.com/) for 2.5 years, primarily as a backend developer on cloud security outsourced project [Palerra](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/palerra/). Here I got a chance to explore Big Data tools like Hadoop and NoSQL databses like Cassandra.

I completed by B.E in Information Technology from Savitribai Phule Pune University, formerly University of Pune. For my final year engineering project I attepted to develope question answering interface to a SQL database.
