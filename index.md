I recently completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna in 2018. Currently on a sabbatical and interested in pursuing research in the areas of Network Science with a focus on social-media and Deep Learning applications in interdisciplinary domains.

Before Pursuing master's, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Persistent Systems](https://www.persistent.com/) for 2.5 years, primarily as a backend developer on cloud security outsourced project [Palerra](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/palerra/). Here I got a chance to explore Big Data tools like Hadoop and NoSQL databases like Cassandra.

I completed my B.E in Information Technology from Savitribai Phule Pune University, formerly University of Pune. For my final year engineering project, I attempted to develop a question answering interface to a SQL database.
