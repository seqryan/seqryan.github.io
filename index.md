[//]: # (I recently completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna in 2018. Currently on a sabbatical and interested in pursuing research in the areas of Network Science with a focus on social-media and graph neural networks, and Deep Learning applications in interdisciplinary domains.)

I completed my Master of Technology in Computer Science form the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IITP), in 2018 With a CGPA of 9.61 and a rank #1. I worked as a research scholar at the same department for 2 years before quiting in July 2020. I am currently on a sabbatical and looking for Machine Learning based jobs.

Before pursuing masters, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Persistent Systems](https://www.persistent.com/) for 2.5 years, primarily as a backend developer on cloud security outsourced project [Palerra](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/palerra/). Here, I got a chance to explore Big Data tools like Hadoop and NoSQL databases like Cassandra.

I completed my B.E in Information Technology from Savitribai Phule Pune University, formerly University of Pune. For my final year engineering project, I attempted to develop a question answering natural language interface to a SQL database.
